KWebTest - Design


KWeb Test Consists of two modules

1) Interactor module
2) Test Module

====================================================================
1) The interactor module:

Interacts with the user. This module has the following classes

1.1) BrowserApp - > The main application, also wraps and represents the browser in memory

1.2) BrowserView -> GUI Representation of the browser

1.3) JsRunner -> Used to do various debugging/running tasks on a live web page. 

1.4) LogWindow -> The log window :)

====================================================================
2) The Test module

2.1) Test -> Represents a test in memory

2.2) TestRunner-> "Runs" a test
2.3) TestRecorder-> "Records" a test

2.4)TestRunnerWidget-> Widget which provides GUI wrapper for TestRunner

2.5) TestRecorderWidget->Widget which provides GUI wrapper for TestRecorder

2.6) TestReader-> Reads the XML file from disk and populates a Test tree

2.7) TestWriter-> Writes the XML file to disk from a populated Test tree 


====================================================================

Run scenarios:
	1) Recording a test for the first time:
		-"Record is clicked on the TestRecordeWidget
		-A new instance of TestRecorder is created
		-TestRecorder creates a new instance of Test
		-TestRecorder emits suitable signal whenever an event occurs (click event and form submit event)
		-TestRecorder has slots which catch these signals and creates corresponding objects in Test hierarchy
		- After testing has finished, give Test to TestWriter and get it done with
	2) Playing back a recorded text
		-Read the file name from the user: use the open dialog
		-Open the file with TestReader
		-TestReader gives us the Test*
		-Pass the test* to TestRunnerWidget
		-TestRunnerWidget spawns a new instance of TestRunner to actually run the test
		-TestRunner has signals, which the widget must catch and display it accordingly
